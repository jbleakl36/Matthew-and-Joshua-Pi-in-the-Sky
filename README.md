## Planning

## Rough sketches, various ideas

## Slingshot is our choice!!

## Materials
* Two wood beams
* One weight (Heaviness is currently undetermined)
* Two Rubber bands (Large)
* Pico
* Accelerometer
* Circuit board
* Four Screws (To secure the wooden beams)
* Two foam ball half circle shells 
* One Holster (For the foam ball)
* One large wood board (For the beams to slide into)

## What is Success     üßê 
Success in our project is constructing a slingshot in a safe and ethical way thay successfully launches a ball which contains a Pico and accelerometer. The accelerometer must also collect the data of its acceleration which can be read when plugged into a computer after the launch.

* Safety Concern 1: Slingshot falls over
  * In order to prevent the slingshot from falling on a person üò±üò±üò±. We will put a weight on the bottom of the slingshot in which the weight exceeds the horizontal component of the tension force from the band, therefore preventing the slingshot from falling
* Safety Concern 2: What if someone is in the way of the foam ball
  * If someone or many someones are in the way of the launch of the ball we will tell everyone to clear out in order to minimize the chances of someone getting hurt or worse üíÄ.
* Safety Concern 3: The slingshot backfires
  * We do not want the slingshot to backfire and hit someone in the face or worse üò≠. Because of this we will have the launcher take safety precasuions like getting out of the way when they launch.


## What do we need to learn?
* How slingshots work
* How to make the launcher safe
* How the circuit boards work
* How to collect data correctly
* how to successfully build the slingshot.

## How will the final project function
The final project will involve two wooden beams in a vertical position with a large band attached. It will behave exactly like a slingshot. We will pull back the band with the holster connected which contains the foam ball in which the pico and accelerometer are inside. When released, the ball will launch and travel a various distance far away from the origin and the accelerometer will collect the total acceleration data. We will then plug in the Pico into the computer and if the data is displayed then our project will have been successful.
