## Planning

## Rough sketches, various ideas

## Slingshot is our choice!!

## Materials
* Two wood beams
* One weight (Heaviness is currently undetermined)
* Two Rubber bands (Large)
* Pico
* Accelerometer
* Circuit board
* Four Screws (To secure the wooden beams)
* Two foam ball half circle shells 
* One Holster (For the foam ball)
* One large wood board (For the beams to slide into)

## What is Success
Success in our project is constructing a slingshot in a safe and ethical way thay successfully launches a ball which contains a Pico and accelerometer. The accelerometer must also collect the data of its acceleration which can be read when plugged into a computer after the launch.

* Safety Concern 1: Slingshot falls over
  * In order to prevent the slingshot from falling on a person ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±. We will put a weight on the bottom of the slingshot in which the weight exceeds the horizontal component of the tension force from the band, therefore preventing the slingshot from falling
